# Python API for USB external display module

This Python API is designed to work with USB based external display module 
available in [here](https://github.com/dilshan/usb-external-display). 
This library works with Python 3.6 or newer versions and it supports many 
operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and Mac.

Python API library uses the serial communication channel established by 
the display module for communication. To use this library display module 
must be in "*API mode*".

This package also has a configuration utility which is useful to 
configure some parameters of the display unit such as idle mode message, 
system time, etc.
